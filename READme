For all future installations of the repository use the libraries listed:
    # Install pipenv if you haven't done so already
    pip install pipenv

    # Use pipenv to install all necessary libraries
    pipenv install pyarduino django pillow celery redis channels websockets daphne channels_redis

if that does not work:
    where pipenv - put it into path environments
    pipenv lock - to update the pipfile

Use this to start the virtual environment:

    Make Sure to run this:
        python manage.py migrate

    Then to start the server run this:
        python manage.py runserver
