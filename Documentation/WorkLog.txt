Zach used ChatGPT on 10/08/2024 to help create the home, user, and manufactuerer webpages with HTML code
because we are not super familiar with HTML code. The main features needed were the buttons and
modern designs for the website.

Zach used ChatGPT on 10/11/2024 to help create the vending machine on the website for the user and manufactuerer
code and then we also changed the formating of the pages to seem similar to the sections they are under,
like the user's color of the page being green and the vending machine page being green.

Mark used ChatGPT on 10/27/2024 to gain a better understanding on how to create the setup file for the objects,
create the frontend needed to update the values of the vending machine, and implement the front end element to update
every couple of seconds.

Mark used ChatGPT on 10/29/2024 to create the setup for the daphne library to make sure the quantity values are able to be
manipulated and update on the website and to make sure they actually change the value.

Mark used ChatGPT on 11/02/2024 to create the html code for the for loop in the manufactuerer page to create the restock buttons
also asked ChatGPT to help with understanding how to connect the buttons using the snack ids and how they could access them to change
the properties of the snacks to change the quantities.

Mark used ChatGPT on 11/03/2024 to finish the buttons for the webpage and create dynamic changes in the website. Also stopped
using websockets and thee daphne library to create the dynamic changes. Instead relied on polling and django commands.
